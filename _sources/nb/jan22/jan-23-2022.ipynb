    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to install a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) jupyer-book\n",
    "\n",
    "- pip installation\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "pip3 install -U jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Or if you use anaconda:\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) jupyter notebook\n",
    "For this, you can just install JupyterLab which will eventually replace the classic jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pip\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "pip3 install jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "- anaconda:\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) ghp-import\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to upload our book to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "pip3 install ghp-import\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making a book\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply copy your jupyter notebook and markdown files into organized directories and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "jupyter-book build [dir]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here ```[dir]``` is the book directory.  This will become clear below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organizing the book\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ```yml``` files that you need to know about:\n",
    "- ```_toc.yml```: Build a table of contents for the book.\n",
    "- ```_config.yml```: Customize the book, title, logo, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the included template below to see how these work.  For example, I have two folders inside the project directory called ```nb``` for notebook and ```md``` for markdown updates.  Whenever I make new progress, I add it to ```nb``` folder, which is further organized by month.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Template\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"../../_extras/template.zip\">Click here to download the template.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Click here to download the template](../../_extras/template.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now go over how to host the book on GitHub.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, log in to GitHub, then go to the \"create a new repository\".  I named it ```jb-template```.\n",
    "2. Navigate to a directory where you want to store the book. Clone the repo.  For example:\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "cd ~/Dropbox/git/\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/hadivafaii/jb-template.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Unzip and copy the content of ```template.zip``` inside the empty ```/jb-template``` directory.\n",
    "4. Define these aliases for building and pushing your book.  Makes it a lot easier:\n",
    "    - Open ```.bashrc``` using your favorite text editor:\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "nano ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - Add these lines:\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "alias jb_build='jupyter-book build $HOME/Dropbox/git/jb-template/; rsync -ar $HOME/Dropbox/git/jb-template/_extras $HOME/Dropbox/git/jb-template/_build/html/'\n",
    "```\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "alias jb_push='cd $HOME/Dropbox/git/jb-template; ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Save & close, then run this:\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!  Now you can add new notebooks to the project and publish the updates to make them available online.  To do this, simply edit ```_toc.yml``` and add the notebook name there.  Then run ```jb_build``` followed by ```jb_push``` to build and upload your book.  After about 10-15 mins your book should be online.  In this example, the URL is [https://hadivafaii.github.io/jb-template](https://hadivafaii.github.io/jb-template)"
